A nimble Mastodon web client made with ðŸ’›.

Elk is in early alpha, but it is already quite usable. We would love your feedback and contributions.

The client is deployed to [elk.zone](https://elk.zone), you can share screenshots on social media but avoid sharing this URL or the discord server until we open the repo.
